# Last.FM Mood Timeline #

Nice script to visualize the mood of a user based on its listening history.

![Example](example.jpg)

Run it with `python mood_timeline.py`.

### How does it work? ###

  1. Get weekly charts using Last.FM's API
  2. Find metadata using GraceNote's API
  3. Do some processing
  4. Plot the graph to SVG (open with Chrome for best viewing experience)

### Why is the code such a mess? ###

The code was written a long time ago to be used just a couple of times and I decided to upload it just for historical purposes :)
